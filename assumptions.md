# Assumptions

## auth_login
* Unable to test whether auth_login is able to handle invalid emails since no user is registered with an invalid email.

## user_test
* Assuming the handle will take the form of first character of the user's first name + the last name
* Assuming the handle will be all lowercase
* Assuming a user with the same name has not been added, thus first char of first name + last name will always be valid.
