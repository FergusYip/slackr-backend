# Assumptions

## auth.py
* Token provided by *auth_login* and *auth_register* are unique to the login session
* A user may have multiple active sessions at once.
* Password length could be upwards of 32 characters.
* Passwords will only consist of ASCII printable characters.
* Email addresses are validated using the method in the GeeksforGeeks article as opposed to RFC documents.

### auth_login
* Unable to test whether *auth_login* is able to handle invalid emails since no user is registered with an invalid email.

### auth_logout
* If an invalid token is provided, *auth_logout* will return true, since the session token is already invalid.

### auth_register
* The generated handle will contain alphanumeric characters.
* Handles generated by *auth_register* are the default handle assigned to the user, the user can choose to change their handle after registration.
* Handles are the concatentation of the user's first and last name converted to lowercase.
* If the generated handle is already taken, a modified handle is assigned to the user.
* Specific testing of how a modified handle is generatedd will be omitted, instead tests will verify that the provided handle is unique.
